Vegans try to live, as much as possible, in a way that avoids exploiting and being cruel to animals.
This means following a plant-based diet.
Vegans do not eat animals or animal-based products like meat, fish, seafood, eggs, honey and dairy products such as cheese.
For many vegans, living a committed vegan lifestyle means not wearing clothes made from animal skins and avoiding any products which have been tested on animals.
